    "#### Q1. Wht is an Exception in pthon? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object that contains information about the error. This allows the program to handle the error gracefully and continue running instead of crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing an undefined variable, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist. Some common types of exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, KeyError, and FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language. This can happen when there is a missing or extra symbol, a misspelled keyword, or a misplaced operator. Syntax errors prevent the program from running and must be fixed before the code can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the code, while syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code. Exceptions can occur even in a syntactically correct program, while syntax errors cannot be caught by the program and must be fixed by the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In below example, the first line contains a syntax error because there is a missing closing parenthesis. This will cause a SyntaxError to be raised and prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line, however, is syntactically correct, but will raise a ZeroDivisionError when executed because it tries to divide by zero. This is an example of an exception that can occur during the execution of the program. To handle this exception, we can use a try/except block to catch the error and handle it gracefully."
